Thank you for giving me opportunity to take the exam

Here's the tools and libraries I used for the exam

* The exam is inside the folder 'assessment'
* I used Bootstrap 4 for css grid
* I used SASS as pre-processor
* I used Vue js to display data from json file
* I used Gulp js as build tools for better management, optimization, testing etc.
* The json file I used is under dist > js > data.json
* Add CSS animation to spice up the design

Bonus points
* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.
* ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a') = ('ba' + NaN + 'a') ==> +'a' is NaN because '+' represents sum which except to be a number and not a character.
* adding toLowerCase make it banana
